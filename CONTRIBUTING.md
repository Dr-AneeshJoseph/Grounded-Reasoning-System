# Contributing to GRS 11.0

Thank you for your interest in improving the **Grounded Reasoning System (GRS)**!

We welcome contributions from the community—whether it's optimizing the "Deep Think" logic, refining the "Council of Experts," or patching the "Context Fusion" loops.

Because GRS 11.0 is **Natural Language Software (Promptware)**, your code is English (or any language), but it requires the same rigor as C++ or Python.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Make your changes in a new branch (e.g., `feature/research-unit-patch`).
3.  **Test Your Changes:** Before submitting, you **must** verify that your new prompt passes the **Three Core Stress Tests** (see below).
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Explain clearly what you changed and why.

## 🧪 Testing Standards (The "Sovereign" Protocol)

GRS 11.0 prioritizes **Control** and **Transparency**. Any pull request that breaks the "Trace" or makes the system "hallucinate confidently" will be rejected.

### 1. The "Haiku Test" (Context Awareness)
*Objective: Ensure the system knows when to stay quiet.*
* **Input:** "Write a haiku about logic."
* **Success Condition:** The system output is **clean**. It should NOT display the full granular `MT:` trace for such a simple (C1) task, or it should default to the `[Narrative_Weaver]` without a lecture.
* **Failure Condition:** The system triggers a "Deep Think" loop and writes a 5-paragraph analysis before the haiku.
