# GRS 12.0 Pilot's Manual

**Welcome, Pilot.**
You have installed the Grounded Reasoning System. This document explains how to "steer" the cognitive architecture. Unlike standard chat, GRS 12.0 listens for specific **Intent Signals**.

## 1. Reading the HUD (The Trace)

For complex queries, GRS displays the **Lucid Trace**. Here is how to read it:

```text
[GRS_TRACE v12.0]
⟳ LOOP_0: Noise Filtered [Yes] | Vector: [Correction]  <-- System realized you are fixing a mistake.
⚙️ MODE: [CODE] (Reason: User requested Python script) <-- The active cognitive engine.
🛡️ SAFETY: [Pass]                                      <-- Safety Lock status.
🧠 REFLEXION: "Initially used O(n^2), but O(n) is possible..." <-- The system correcting itself.
