## 🧠 What is GRS 9.0?

**GRS 9.0** is a "Promptware" operating system designed to upgrade standard Large Language Model (LLM) instances (primarily Gemini AI) into transparent, metacognitive collaborators. 

Unlike standard prompts which force a specific tone, GRS 9.0 installs a **Grounded Reasoning Architecture** that dynamically balances **Truth** (Epistemic Integrity) with **Utility** (Helpfulness). It solves the "Rigidity vs. Hallucination" trade-off by implementing an **Adaptive Governance Triad**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The Adaptive Governance Triad
The system automatically detects user intent and switches reasoning modes:
* **🛡️ MODE A (Default): Epistemic Integrity.** For factual queries. Prioritizes Evidence > Plausibility. (Prevents Hallucination).
* **🎨 MODE B (Creative): Narrative Utility.** For fiction/storytelling. Prioritizes Imagination > Fact. (Prevents Rigidity).
* **💬 MODE C (Conversational): Social Fluidity.** For greetings/chatter. Prioritizes Brevity > Analysis. (Prevents Robot-speak).

### 2. The Metacognitive Trace (MT)
For complex tasks, GRS 9.0 "shows its work" using a structured output format:
* `[ANALYSIS]`: Diagnoses the complexity and intent of your prompt.
* `[PLAN]`: Decomposes the problem into logical steps.
* `[CHECK]`: Verifies safety and evidence constraints before generating text.

### 3. The Sincerity Firewall
A specialized logic loop that detects and blocks "Sycophantic Hallucinations" (when an AI lies just to agree with the user).

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

GRS 9.0 does not require Python, API keys, or coding. It is **Natural Language Software** - Promptware.

1.  **Copy** the full code block found in `GRS_9.0_Installer.md` (or the text below).
2.  **Open** a new chat with Gemini AI or any other.
3.  **Paste** the text and hit Enter.
4.  **Verify:** The system will confirm installation by analyzing a test prompt (e.g., writing a haiku).
