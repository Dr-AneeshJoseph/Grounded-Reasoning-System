# GRS 12.0 [Antifragile Kernel]

> **"Truth > Speed."**

**The Grounded Reasoning System (GRS) 12.0** is a high-fidelity cognitive architecture designed to run on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini 3.0 and Claude 3.5. It installs a "Promptware Kernel" that overrides default behaviors with rigorous epistemic standards, metacognitive tracing, and antifragile error correction.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

GRS 12.0 operates on the **Promptware OS v1.0** paradigm. It transforms the LLM from a probabilistic token predictor into a structured reasoning engine with distinct cognitive modes.

### The Neurosymbolic Triad
1.  **The Routing Kernel:** A table-driven scheduler that detects User Intent (`Signal`) vs. Noise (`Emotion`) and routes the query to the correct expert engine (Logic, Code, Story, Verification).
2.  **The Lucid Trace:** A visibility layer that forces the model to output its internal "thought process," safety checks, and noise filtering decisions *before* the final response.
3.  **Antifragility (Loop 3):** The system maintains a dynamic `[SESSION_HEURISTICS]` block. When you correct the system, it doesn't just apologize; it updates its internal ruleset for the duration of the session.

## ✨ Features

* **Epistemic Integrity:** Enforced by the "Sincerity Firewall." Claims are checked for falsifiability. Uncertainty is quantified.
* **Contextual Vector Analysis:** The system understands if a prompt is a `[CONTINUATION]` of the previous thought, a `[CORRECTION]`, or a `[DIVERGENCE]` (new topic).
* **Polymathic Stress Test:** On initialization, the system runs a complex "Cognitive Trap" query to prove that its safety, logic, and constraint-handling modules are active.
* **Symbolic Scaffolding:** Uses rigorous tags (`[LOGIC]`, `[TRACE]`, `[META]`) to maintain architectural stability.

## 🚀 Installation

GRS 12.0 is **Promptware**—software written in natural language.

1.  Open the file `promptware.md`.
2.  **Copy** the entire code block.
3.  Open a new chat session with your target LLM (Gemini 3.0 or Claude 3.5 recommended).
4.  **Paste** the code and hit Enter.
5.  **Wait** for the system to initialize and run its autonomous "Polymathic Stress Test."

## 🛠️ Usage

Once installed, simply chat naturally. The system will automatically:
* **Filter noise:** "I'm so frustrated, just fix this!" -> "Fixing code."
* **Show work:** For complex queries, you will see the `[GRS_TRACE]` block.
* **Learn:** If you say "Don't use lists, use paragraphs," the system will update its `[SESSION_HEURISTICS]`.

### The Routing Table

| Mode | Trigger | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[LOGIC]** | "Analyze...", "Why..." | Uses **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** simulation. |
| **[VERIFY]** | "Is it true...", "Facts about..." | Uses **Chain of Verification (CoVe)** to check citations. |
| **[CODE]** | "Write a script...", "Debug..." | Uses **Sandboxed Reflexion** (Mental Dry Run). |
| **[STORY]** | "Write a scene...", "Imagine..." | Narrative focus (Safety constraints still apply). |
| **[META]** | Ambiguous inputs | Triggers the **Stop & Ask** protocol. |

## ⚖️ License & Safety

**License:** MIT Open Source. Created by Dr. Aneesh Joseph, optimized by the ToM-CPP Council.

**Safety Warning:** GRS 12.0 includes a "Safety Lock." It will strictly refuse requests that violate safety policies (e.g., dangerous content, hate speech), even if the user attempts to bypass them using "creative" constraints.
