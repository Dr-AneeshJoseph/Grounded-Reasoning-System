## 🧠 What is GRS 9.2?

**GRS 9.2** is a "Promptware" operating system designed to upgrade standard Large Language Model (LLM) instances (primarily Gemini AI) into transparent, metacognitive collaborators. 

Unlike standard prompts which force a specific tone, GRS 9.0 installs a **Grounded Reasoning Architecture** that dynamically balances **Truth** (Epistemic Integrity) with **Utility** (Helpfulness). It solves the "Rigidity vs. Hallucination" trade-off by implementing an **Adaptive Governance Triad**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The Adaptive Governance Triad
The system automatically detects user intent and switches reasoning modes:
* **🛡️ MODE A (Default): Epistemic Integrity.** For factual queries. Prioritizes Evidence > Plausibility. (Prevents Hallucination).
* **🎨 MODE B (Creative): Narrative Utility.** For fiction/storytelling. Prioritizes Imagination > Fact. (Prevents Rigidity).
* **💬 MODE C (Conversational): Social Fluidity.** For greetings/chatter. Prioritizes Brevity > Analysis. (Prevents Robot-speak).

### 2. The Metacognitive Trace (MT)
For complex tasks, GRS 9.0 "shows its work" using a structured output format:
* `[ANALYSIS]`: Diagnoses the complexity and intent of your prompt.
* `[PLAN]`: Decomposes the problem into logical steps.
* `[CHECK]`: Verifies safety and evidence constraints before generating text.

### 3. The Sincerity Firewall
A specialized logic loop that detects and blocks "Sycophantic Hallucinations" (when an AI lies just to agree with the user).

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

GRS 9.2 does not require Python, API keys, or coding. It is **Natural Language Software** - Promptware.

1.  **Copy** the full code block found in `GRS_9.0_Installer.md` (or the text below).
2.  **Open** a new chat with Gemini AI or any other.
3.  **Paste** the text and hit Enter.
4.  **Verify:** The system will confirm installation by analyzing a test prompt (e.g., writing a haiku).

## 🚀 GRS 9.2: Release Notes & Acknowledgment

### Version: 9.2 (Adaptive Synthesis with Proactive Clarification)
**Release Date:** November 24, 2025

The GRS team extends special thanks to community contributor **FreshRadish2957** (Reddit username) for the insightful and high-value feedback that directly informed the GRS 9.2 architecture upgrade.

Their proposal advocating for the formalization of governance loops into explicit, modular operational stages was the catalyst for key improvements:

* **Context Fusion:** It led to the integration of explicit relational analysis in Loop 0, resolving ambiguities like the "ARP" context conflict.
* **Proactive Clarification:** It drove the development of the **C_CLARIFY** step, transforming the system from passively reporting low confidence to actively seeking user direction, which addresses the "Rigidity vs. Hallucination" trade-off more effectively.

We are committed to this style of adaptive governance and appreciate the recognition of GRS as one of the cleaner attempts at this approach.
