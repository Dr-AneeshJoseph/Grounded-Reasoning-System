🌐 What is GRS 11.0?
GRS 11.0 is a "System Integration" package—a high-fidelity cognitive layer designed to run on top of Large Language Models (specifically Gemini 3.0+).
Unlike standard prompts that act as simple "jailbreaks" or "personas," GRS installs a Grounded Reasoning Architecture. It transforms the LLM from a passive answering machine into a transparent, metacognitive collaborator.
The Core Philosophy:
 * Safety > Speed: The system will stop and ask for clarification rather than guessing.
 * Transparency > Magic: The system visualizes its "Thought Trace" (MT:) and internal routing before every complex answer.
 * Agency > Automation: You choose the Expert. You control the constraints.
✨ Key Features: The Sovereign Architecture
GRS 11.0 introduces the "Sovereign" protocol, giving the user absolute control over how the AI thinks.
1. 🏛️ The Council of Experts (MoE Routing)
Instead of a single generic personality, GRS dynamically routes your prompt to a specific internal expert. You can see who is active and "Reroute" them at will.
 * 🧠 [Logic_Core]: Pure reasoning using the 5-Layer Analysis Framework. (Strict Truth).
 * 📚 [Research_Unit]: Fact retrieval and citation verification.
 * 🛠️ [Syntax_Architect]: Code generation with Sandboxed Verification.
 * 🎨 [Narrative_Weaver]: The only expert allowed to bypass the "Sincerity Firewall" for creative writing.
2. 🛑 The "Stop & Ask" Protocol (Loop 1)
If your prompt is ambiguous, GRS 11.0 will not answer. It triggers the MT:C_CLARIFY loop, halting generation to ask you: "Do you mean X or Y?" This dramatically reduces confident hallucinations.
3. 🔍 Granular Metacognitive Trace
We have restored the deep-dive visibility from early GRS versions. Before the final answer, you see the system's brain at work:
 * MT:Loop_0: Context Fusion (How this relates to previous messages).
 * MT:I_NOTICE: Intent Analysis (What the user actually wants).
 * MT:P_PLAN: Strategy (Which mental framework is being applied).
4. 🧠 Active Learning (Loop 3)
The system learns from interaction. The [LEARNING] slot in the HUD captures your preferences or new axioms derived from the conversation, allowing the system to behave better over time within the context window.
🚀 Installation Instructions
GRS 11.0 is Natural Language Software (Promptware). It requires no API keys or Python environment—just a chat interface.
 * Copy the code block found in GRS_11.0_Integration.md (or copy the "System Integration" prompt below).
 * Open a fresh session with your LLM (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude).
 * Paste the text and hit Enter.
 * Initialize: The system will automatically execute an "Identity Declaration" and guide you on how to use the "Reroute" and "Trace" features.
📖 How to "Drive" GRS 11.0
Once installed, you will see a Head-Up Display (HUD) above complex responses. Use this to control the system:
The HUD:
> [ACTIVE EXPERT]: 🛠️ [Syntax_Architect]
> [ALTERNATIVES]: 🎨 [Narrative_Weaver], 🧠 [Logic_Core]
> 
User Commands:
 * "Reroute to Narrative_Weaver" -> Forces the system to retell the answer as a story.
 * "Use 5-Layer Framework" -> Forces the Logic_Core to do a deep system analysis.
 * "Clarify" -> If the Trace shows the system misunderstood your intent, tell it immediately.
