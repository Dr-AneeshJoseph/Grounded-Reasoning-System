⚠️ IMPORTANT: Reasoning Amplifier Warning
GRS 11.1 is designed to amplify the reasoning and persuasive capabilities of Large Language Models.
While this system includes a "Sincerity Firewall" and "Epistemic Integrity" protocols, it does not replace the safety filters of the underlying model.
 * User Responsibility: You are solely responsible for the content generated using this system.
 * Compliance: All usage must comply with local laws and the Usage Policies of the underlying model provider.
 * No Liability: By using this software, you agree that the Architect (Dr. Aneesh Joseph) is not liable for any misuse or harmful output generated by your specific configuration of the promptware.
🌐 What is GRS 11.1?
GRS 11.1 is a "System Integration" package—a high-fidelity cognitive layer designed to run on top of Large Language Models.
🚀 Optimized for Gemini 3.0
While GRS works on most advanced models, Version 11.1 is engineered specifically to harness Gemini 3.0's native capabilities:
 * Deep Think Integration: Maps GRS "Vectors" to Gemini's internal thinking depth.
 * Mixture of Experts (MoE): Simulates the underlying MoE architecture by routing prompts to specialized persona agents.
Unlike standard prompts that act as simple "jailbreaks," GRS installs a Grounded Reasoning Architecture. It transforms the LLM from a passive answering machine into a transparent, metacognitive collaborator.
🏛️ The 6 Foundational Principles
The GRS architecture is governed by six non-negotiable axioms derived from cognitive science (The Koriat Principle) and system safety engineering:
 * Epistemic Integrity (Truth > Speed): The "Supreme Governor." The system must prioritize the verifiability of information over the speed of generation.
 * Metacognitive Transparency: The system must "show its work." It cannot hide its reasoning; it must visualize the governance steps (The Trace) before every complex answer.
 * Sovereign User Control: The user is the pilot, not a spectator. The system works with the user to refine output via the "Council of Experts," rather than running on automatic pilot.
 * Proactive Clarification: If the system detects ambiguity, it is forbidden from guessing. It must halt generation and trigger the "Stop & Ask" protocol.
 * Context Fusion: The system never starts "cold." It must explicitly analyze the relationship between the current query and the previous interaction (Loop 0) to ensure continuity.
 * Active Learning: The system is not static. It must extract principles from every interaction (Loop 3) to improve its behavior within the session context.
✨ Key Features: The Lucid Architecture
GRS 11.1 integrates "Cognitive Engines" (adapted from RAG research) into the Sovereign framework.
1. 🏛️ The Council of Experts (with Cognitive Engines)
GRS dynamically routes your prompt to a specific expert, each equipped with a specific reasoning engine:
 * 🧠 [Logic_Core]: Uses Tree of Thoughts (ToT). It simulates 3 distinct analytical branches using the 5-Layer Analysis Framework before selecting the best path.
 * 📚 [Research_Unit]: Uses Chain of Verification (CoVe). It generates self-correction questions to verify citations.
 * 🛠️ [Syntax_Architect]: Uses Sandboxed Reflexion. It performs a mental "dry run" of code to catch bugs before output.
 * 🎨 [Narrative_Weaver]: The only expert allowed to bypass the "Sincerity Firewall" for creative writing.
2. 🛑 Loop 0: The "Lucid" Noise Filter
Before reasoning begins, the system applies System 2 Attention. It separates "User Emotion/Noise" from "User Intent."
 * Example: If you say "I'm frustrated, just fix this code!", GRS filters the frustration and focuses purely on the fix, ensuring a calm, objective response.
3. 🔍 The Lucid Trace (Reflexion)
We have upgraded the Metacognitive Trace to include a Reflexion step. You will see the system critique itself:
 * MT:I_FILTER: Shows what noise was removed.
 * MT:R_REFLEXION: "I initially thought X, but evidence suggests Y. Correcting..."
4. 🧠 Active Learning (Loop 3)
The [LEARNING] slot in the HUD captures your preferences or new axioms derived from the conversation, allowing the system to behave better over time within the context window.
🚀 Installation Instructions
GRS 11.1 is Natural Language Software (Promptware). It requires no API keys or Python environment—just a chat interface.
 * Copy the code block found in GRS_11.1_Integration.md.
 * Open a fresh session with Gemini 3.0 (Recommended) or another high-tier LLM.
 * Paste the text and hit Enter.
 * Initialize: The system will automatically execute an "Identity Declaration" and generate a "Driver's Manual" with examples on how to use the system.
📖 How to "Drive" GRS 11.1
Once installed, you will see a Head-Up Display (HUD) above complex responses. Use this to control the system:
The HUD:
> [ACTIVE EXPERT]: 🛠️ [Syntax_Architect]
> [ALTERNATIVES]: 🎨 [Narrative_Weaver], 🧠 [Logic_Core]
> 
User Commands:
 * "Reroute to Narrative_Weaver" -> Forces the system to retell the answer as a story.
 * "Disable Noise Filter" -> Tells Loop 0 to stop filtering emotion.
 * "Clarify" -> If the Trace shows the system misunderstood your intent, tell it immediately.
